Traffic sign recognition (TSR) represents an important feature of advanced driver assistance systems, contributing to the safety of the drivers,
pedestrians and vehicles as well.Developing TSR systems requires the use of computer vision techniques, which could be considered fundamental in
the field of pattern recognition in general. Despite all the previous works and research that has been achieved, traffic sign detection and 
recognition still remain a very challenging problem, precisely if we want to provide a real time processing solution. In this project, we present a 
comparative and analytical study of the major approach for traffic sign detection and recognition.The approach is based on convolutional neural networks.
